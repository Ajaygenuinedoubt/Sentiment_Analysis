Here’s a step-by-step README file to guide someone through setting up, running, and deploying your Flask-based sentiment analysis app on GitHub:

---

# Sentiment Analysis Flask App

This repository contains a web application that performs sentiment analysis on text inputs using a pre-trained machine learning model. The model is trained using the `RandomForestClassifier` and processes text data to predict whether the sentiment is **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.

## Features
- Input text through a web interface.
- Predict sentiment: **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.
- Trained using a machine learning model based on `RandomForestClassifier`.
- Model and vectorizer are serialized into `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`.

---

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x**
2. **pip** (Python package manager)

The necessary Python packages are listed below:

- `pandas`
- `faker`
- `scikit-learn`
- `flask`

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-flask-app.git
cd sentiment-analysis-flask-app
```

### 2. Install the Required Packages

Use `pip` to install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if the `requirements.txt` file is missing, manually install the packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas faker scikit-learn flask
```

### 3. Training the Model (Optional)

If you'd like to train the model from scratch, follow these steps:

- Use the code provided in the `train_model.py` file to generate random text data and train the sentiment analysis model.
- Once trained, the model is saved as `model.pkl`, and the TF-IDF vectorizer as `vectorizer.pkl`.

To train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will output the model's accuracy and generate the required `.pkl` files for the web app.

---

## Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed and the model is trained, you can start the Flask app using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Access the Web App

Once the Flask server is running, open your web browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

You will see a simple web page where you can input text and click the "Analyze" button to see the sentiment prediction.

## Training the Model

The `train_model.py` script generates a random dataset of 10,000 rows with three columns: `id`, `text`, and `sentiment`. It then trains a `RandomForestClassifier` using a TF-IDF vectorizer for text feature extraction.

To retrain the model:

1. Run the script using `python train_model.py`.
2. After training, it will save the model and vectorizer to `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`, respectively.
3. The model's performance on training and test data will be displayed after training.

### Example Usage:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

---

## Future Improvements

- Improve the accuracy of the model by trying different machine learning algorithms.
- Integrate more advanced NLP techniques such as `BERT` or `GPT` for better text understanding.
- Add user authentication for the web app.
- Improve the frontend design for better user experience.
